  into account the copter yaw while controlling it's state. Also, The
  virtual function for generating a linear and angular twist for a
  desired pose is defined here. Other than that, the class does not do
  anything and only serves as a superclass for controllers such as the
  P-controller (CPController). */

    The control signal depends on the current pose of the copter, as
    well, as the desired set point given as DSControlSetPoint. For
    more elaborate controllers, it might also depend on an internal
    controller state. The return value is a DSVelocityControlSignal in
    which the angular twist as well as the thrust to be sent to the
    copter's internal controller is stored.
    
    \param dspCurrent The current pose of the copter. This is supplied
    by an instance of the governing class, i.e. CCrazyflie \param
    cspDesired Denoted the desired set point, consisting of R^3
    position and optional yaw (depending on the ignoresYaw() value)
    
    \return Returns the controller output signal, containing absolute
    roll, pitch, yaw and thrust values to be sent to the copter. */
