    This influences the 'aggressiveness' of the controller.
    
    Values > 1 will render the controller unstable due to
    over-proportional overshoot, < 1 will invert it's purpose
    (i.e. move away from the set point and also become
    unstable). Setting it to zero switches off the control ability.
    
    Valid values are between 0 < p < 1. The exact value depends on the
    purpose and should be tried out. Start at around p = 0.5.
